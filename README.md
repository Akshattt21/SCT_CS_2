# Image Encryption and Decryption Project

This project demonstrates a simple image encryption and decryption process using Python.

## 📁 Files Included
- `encrypt.py` — Script to encrypt an image  
- `decrypt.py` — Script to decrypt an encrypted image  
- `input.png` — Original input image  
- `encrypted.png` — Encrypted output image  
- `decrypted.png` — Decrypted image after running decryption script

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The `encrypt.py` script takes an image (`input.png`) and applies a simple encryption algorithm to produce `encrypted.png`.
2. The `decrypt.py` script reverses the process, restoring the original image as `decrypted.png`.
